# Sentimental Analysis

## Overview
Sentimental Analysis is a project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify text data based on its sentiment. The main objective of this project is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of a given text using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning algorithms, such as **Naive Bayes** to classify the sentiment of the text. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and is capable of predicting the sentiment of new, unseen text.

### Key Features:
- Text preprocessing using **Tokenization**, **Lemmatization**, and **Stop Word Removal**.
- Sentiment classification (positive, negative).
- Visualizations for sentiment distribution.
- An interactive Jupyter notebook to run and visualize the analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
